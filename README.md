   - Segmented passengers by Class, Age, and Type of Travel.

3. **Dashboard Design**
   - Used Pivot Tables to summarize metrics.  
   - Added Slicers for Gender, Class, and Customer Type.  
   - Designed two pages:
     - Page 1: *Overall Performance Overview*  
     - Page 2: *Detailed Service Ratings & Insights*

4. **Visualization**
   - Used bar charts, donut charts, and KPIs.  
   - Applied a professional color palette and clean layout.

## 🔎 Key Insights (from Dashboard & Report)

1. **Top Airlines:** IndiGo, Vistara, and Emirates show the highest satisfaction rates.  
2. **Class Impact:** Business Class passengers report the highest satisfaction; Economy is lowest.  
3. **Delay Trends:** Average flight delay is around 15 minutes; medium-distance flights face the most delays.  
4. **Service Quality:** Wi-Fi, food quality, and entertainment are the strongest drivers of satisfaction.  

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Upgrade Economy Services:** Improve Wi-Fi, meals, and seating comfort.  
2. **Reduce Mid-Range Flight Delays:** Optimize scheduling for 1000–3000-mile routes.
